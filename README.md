# Blonkus
This is Blonkus, a small project I made with **Ollama** and **Flask**

after watching this video called [*i prompt injected apple intelligence - Evan Zhou*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4Yba_JVFU8), and decided to make my own AI Tool.

It uses qwen2.5:1.5B by default but you should change it

## Prerequisites 
1. Python Libraries
- ollama 0.3.3
- flask
2. Ollama
- qwen2.5:1.5B (used by default. can be changed)
   

## Explaning the files
1. agents.py - the file which runs ollama. If you want to change the model, look here.
2. main.py - the file to run to start the website!
